An interactive terminal shell is both an interpreter and and a scripting language. Mostly uses bash for my purposes but others exist such as zsh.

This shell can be used in most non-Windows cases, exp [[Linux]] 

[[Programming]]

In LINUX the main shells are 
Bourne, C shell, Korn, and Bash. There is important history here, but I'll hit that up in another day.

For starters the following will tell you what shell you are using. 
```
echo $SHELL # what shell am i?
chs # change shell
set # displays all variables availabe in current shell
```

By convention enivironment variables are defined in Uppercase
