in [[Linux]]
du will show disk usage
-c gives the grand total
-h human readable
-x to exclude
-- time options
-a all

I have used this command when I am looking to free up some space. 


df will show free disk space 
this command can be run by anyuser

-i shows inodes
-h human readable
--total to get total available space
-t type

I used both of these together when I had to figure out how to to open up some space on a deb box that I used with a limited amount of space. df was helpful in finding the best places to look, and du was helpful in finding what to look for
