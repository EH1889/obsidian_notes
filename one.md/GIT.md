git add <filename>
git add --all
```


Git project notes:

aug 1 - 
built out ssh keys and added them to github account.
tried to figure out how to sync Obsidain to a private git repo on github. I realized that the project will be much more complicated and I must learn how git works before I can continue in earnest. 


git add
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin 
git push -u origin main

working on a tutorial with W3 schools

added a .git in the Obsidian Vault folder. This makes it a git repo I believe
files can in the folder can be Tracked or Untracked. check the status with, git status.
To get git to track the status the files must be staged, to stage a file use the git add command
